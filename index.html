      <p>"As you go through life, whatever be your goal, keep you eye on the doughnut and not on the hole." -Unknown</p>
      <p>This quote is about not missing out on life. you need to be looking at and enjoying the right things in life or before you know it, 
        you will be looking back on nothing. Your life will be gone and you will not have made the amazing memories along the way.
  </p>
      <p>I love to be with my family. My wife and I have been married 7 years. We have 2 amazing children. Anytime I spend with them is so great. I also love to mountain bike, skateboard, ski/snowboard or skimboard in my free time.  </p>
      <p>I attended Utah Valley University in Orem Utah. I earned a Bachelors degree in Psychology and minored in Digital Media. I enjoy graphic design and all things printed media. I am excited to learn more about web development! It is an ever changing and advancing industry that is challenging and fun.</p>
