      <p>"As you go through life, whatever be your goal, keep you eye on the doughnut and not on the hole." -Unknown</p>
      <p>This quote is about not missing out on life. you need to be looking at and enjoynig the right things in life or before you know it, 
      you will be looking back on nothing. Your life will be gone and you will not have made the amazing memories along the way.</p>
